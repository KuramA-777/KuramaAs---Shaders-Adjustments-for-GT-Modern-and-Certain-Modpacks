# KuramaAs---Shaders-Adjustments-for-GT-Modern-and-Certain-Modpacks



#   This is my Edit/Adjustments of both the Solas and Photon Shaders, specifically for GregTechCEu Modern and 2 Modpacks using it. It Adds alot of Building Related and GT Blocks to be Emissive/Colored Lighting and Reflective sections of each Shader. Showcase via imgur album links further below.

- How to Install

- 1. Download the Original Shaders this is based on from the Links here below

    - Photon -> https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader/version/v1.1
    - Solas  -> https://modrinth.com/shader/solas-shader/version/2.8b
 
  2.  
    - then inside your shaderpacks folder create a new folder called "photon_v1.1" and "Solas Shader V2.8b" respectively , then extract the contents of the shaders zip you downloaded into each respective folder you made, so that inside the folder there now should be a folder called "shaders" and either a LICENSE + README file for Photon or a "wmark" folder for Solas. If done all Correctly it should work and you can quickly edit the block.properties file anytime without further unzipping/zipping up.

  3.
    - now go downlaod my edits via the big green "code" button and hit "Download Zip", then from here on you should be able to just copy and paste the contents of the aptly named folder into your shaderpacks folder and just overwrite both the block.properties file and the config file without issues.

  4. Enjoy ?

- A little Warning

  Solas has a bug with Emissive Ores and AE2 Storage Drives, where they flicker intensively while TAA is turned on.
